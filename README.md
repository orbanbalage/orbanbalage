- 👋 Hi, I’m @orbanbalage ☕ 
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things (very specific I know :trollface:)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Scala, algorithms, a bit all over the place
- 💞️ I’m looking to break free of tutorials and learn by doing, one babystep a time
- 🤖 I'm moving my content over to GitHub (to make the Github Contribution Graph look 😎 –> ps. don't do this: [Hack Github Contribution Graph in 20 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q--gA97caM))

- 🎱 🎲 🔮 ✨ Not sure about the future, but Nana breaks it down: [Is DevOps right for me? What it takes to be a DevOps Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms_jTcERvMY) –> it would be a perfect fit for my ADHD... 🤷
