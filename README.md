- 👋 Hi, my name is [[ˈbɒlaːʒ]](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%5B%CB%88b%C9%92la%CB%90%CA%92%5D&voice=) (ie. _Blaise_ in Hungarian)
- 🏡 I grew up in 🇸🇰 in the 🇭🇺 speaking community – also fluent in 🇩🇪,🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
- 👀 I’m a curious guy with a big mouth (and atypical ADHD ideas & associations)
- 🌱 I’m currently working with PowerShell, but also learning other stuff...
- 🤖 Finally move some stuff over to GitHub? (to make the Github Contribution Graph look 😎 –> ps. don't do this: [Hack Github Contribution Graph in 20 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q--gA97caM))

- 🎱 🎲 🔮 ✨ Not sure about the future, is Nana the way?: [Is DevOps right for me? What it takes to be a DevOps Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms_jTcERvMY) –> it would be a perfect fit for my ADHD... 🤷
